        "3. **Try sample queries**:\n",
        "   - LAB1_SEARCH_AGENT: \"Find documents about retirement planning\"\n",
        "   - LAB2_ANALYST_AGENT: \"What's the portfolio performance by region?\"\n",
        "   - LAB3_SEARCH_AGENT: \"What are the key investment trends in 2023?\"\n",
        "\n",
        "#### ❌ If Tests Fail:\n",

        "2. **Verify Permissions**: Make sure you have rights to create agents and procedures\n",
        "3. **Update Configuration**: Double-check service names in the configuration section\n",
        "4. **Check Error Messages**: Review any error output from the test cells above\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 📧 To Enable Email Summaries:\n",
        "1. **Configure Email Integration**: Set up a notification integration in Snowflake\n",
        "2. **Update Configuration**: Replace placeholder values in the configuration section\n",
        "3. **Test Email**: Uncomment and run the email test cell\n",
