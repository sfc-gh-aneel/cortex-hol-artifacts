## üé™ Demo Script

For a complete demonstration, run these queries in sequence:

1. **Start Simple**: `test query` *(verify connectivity)*
2. **Show Analysis**: `How does performance vs target vary by advisor region?` *(demonstrate analyst)*
3. **Show Search**: `Find information about 401k salary reduction agreements` *(demonstrate search)*
4. **Show Integration**: `Email adam.neel@snowflake.com about the latest performance analysis` *(demonstrate email)*
5. **Show Power**: `Analyze top performing advisors and find compliance documentation` *(demonstrate combination)*

## üîß Troubleshooting Queries

If you encounter issues, try these diagnostic queries:

### Test Individual Services
```

Show me advisor regions
```
*Should only trigger analyst service*

### Error Testing
```
Send email to invalid@external.com
```
*Should fail gracefully with proper error message*
